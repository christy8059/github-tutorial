## Git vs. GitHub
_Git_ is a version control that keeps "snapshots" of your code, while _Github_ stores your code in the cloud. Since the code is stored on the cloud we are able to visually track changes. Also we're able to collaborate on the same project.   
* The difference is that _Git_ does not require github, but _github_ requies git.

## Initial Setup
**_Making a github account_**  
If you already have a github account you may skip steps 1-3  
1. To make an account you need to go to [github.com](https://github.com/)  
2. Then you press on the green button that says "sign up" 
3. And then you get to a page where you type into your user name, email and password

## Repository Setup 
To make a repository on Github
1. on the home page of github you will see a green button that says "new repository"
2. Then you give it a name that is the same as the one you put for cloud9. For example: if its "first-repo" on cloud9, you would put "first-repo" on github.
