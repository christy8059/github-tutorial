# GitHub Tutorial

## Git vs. GitHub
_Git_ is a version control that keeps "snapshots" of your code, while _Github_ stores your code in the cloud. Since the code is stored on the cloud we are able to visually track changes. Also we're able to collaborate on the same project.   
* The difference is that _Git_ does not require github, but _github_ requies git.
